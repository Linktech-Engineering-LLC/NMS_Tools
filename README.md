NMS_Tools is a suite of deterministic, operator‑grade monitoring tools designed for Nagios, automation pipelines, and Linux‑based operational workflows.  
Each tool is built with:

- deterministic behavior  
- reproducible output  
- zero side effects in Nagios mode  
- operator‑grade logging  
- consistent architecture and documentation  

The suite is intentionally modular — each tool is self‑contained, predictable, and easy to deploy.

## 📦 Packaging & Installation

NMS_Tools ships with full Linux-native packaging support, including:

- **DEB packages** (Debian / Ubuntu)
- **RPM packages** (RHEL / Rocky / Alma / Fedora / openSUSE)
- **Man pages** for every tool
- **Build scripts** for local packaging

All packaging assets live under:

```
packaging/
    debian/     # DEB metadata
    rpm/        # RPM spec file
    build_deb.sh
    build_rpm.sh
    build_all.sh
```

During packaging, all Markdown man pages in `man/*.md` are automatically
converted to groff (`.1`, `.7`) and installed into the appropriate man
directories. No manual groff editing is required.

### Install (DEB)

```
sudo dpkg -i nms-tools_<version>_all.deb
```

### Install (RPM)

```
sudo rpm -ivh nms_tools-<version>.noarch.rpm
```

---

## 📘 Man Pages

NMS_Tools includes full operator-grade man pages for every tool.

After installation:

```
man check_ports
man check_weather
man check_cert
man check_html
man check_interfaces
man nms_tools
```

Man page sources live in:

```
man/
    check_ports.1.md
    check_weather.1.md
    check_cert.1.md
    check_html.1.md
    check_interfaces.1.md
    nms_tools.7.md
```

These are automatically converted to groff during packaging.

---

## 🧰 Build From Source

To build both DEB and RPM packages locally:

```
./packaging/build_all.sh
```

Or individually:

```
./packaging/build_deb.sh
./packaging/build_rpm.sh
```

This generates:

- `.deb` packages in the project root  
- `.rpm` packages under `~/rpmbuild/RPMS/`  

---

## Versioning and Build Types

NMS_Tools uses automatic version stamping to ensure every build is traceable,
reproducible, and uniquely identifiable.

### Base Version
The base version is defined in:

- `packaging/debian/control` (for DEB builds)
- `packaging/rpm/nms_tools.spec` (for RPM builds)

Example:

Version: 1.0.0

Code

### Push Builds (Standard)
When building normally (e.g., `make packages` or CI push builds), the version
remains the base version:

1.0.0

Code

### Nightly Builds
Nightly builds automatically append a date and commit hash:

1.0.0+20260421.git3f2a9c

Code

This provides:

- exact build date  
- exact commit reference  
- deterministic reproducibility  

Nightly builds are triggered by GitHub Actions and set:

NIGHTLY=1

Code

### Version Banner in Man Page
The suite-level man page (`nms_tools.7`) includes a version banner injected at
build time:

Version: 1.0.0+20260421.git3f2a9c
Build Type: Nightly
Build Date: 20260421
Commit: 3f2a9c

Code

To preview the banner locally:

make preview-man

### ✔ **check_weather**  
Weather condition evaluator with rule‑based enforcement.  
Evaluates weather conditions using a deterministic rule engine and provider registry.
Supports JSON output, verbose diagnostics, and rule‑based condition evaluation.

Typical usage:

```check_weather.py --location "St John, KS"```
```check_weather.py --location 67576 --json```

[check_weather/README.md](check_weather/README.md)

### ✔ **check_cert**  
Certificate expiration and metadata checker.  
Performs deterministic TLS certificate inspection, expiration evaluation, SAN/issuer checks, and chain reconstruction.
Provides JSON metadata extraction and Nagios‑grade policy enforcement.

Typical usage:

```check_cert.py -H example.com```
```check_cert.py -H api.example.com --json```

### ✔ **check_html**  
HTML content validator with rule‑based enforcement.  
Deterministic HTTP/HTTPS inspection with status, headers, content‑type, and backend validation.
Supports JSON output, backend enforcement, and Nagios‑aware severity merging.

Typical usage:

```check_html.py -H example.com```
```check_html.py -H example.com --expect-backend nginx```

[check_html/README.md](check_html/README.md)

### ✔ **check_interfaces**  
Network interface state and SNMP‑based status checker.  
Evaluates network interface state using SNMP and local inspection.
Provides deterministic admin/oper status mapping, JSON output, and operator‑grade logging.

# Philosophy

NMS_Tools is built around a few core principles:

- **Determinism** — same input, same output, every time  
- **Operator‑grade clarity** — readable logs, predictable behavior  
- **Zero side effects** — Nagios mode never writes logs or files  
- **Modularity** — each tool is self‑contained  
- **Reproducibility** — consistent architecture across the suite  
- **Transparency** — clear documentation and predictable evaluation rules

# Roadmap

See the full roadmap here:

- Named port support in `check_ports` (e.g., `https` → 443 via `/etc/services`)  
- Flags class rollout to all remaining tools  
- Unified logging lifecycle across the suite  
- Additional operator‑grade documentation  
- Future tool additions (DNS, SSH, HTTP latency, etc.)
